<p align = "justify"> 
I obtained dual doctoral degrees in Geomatics from China University of Geosciences (Beijing) and in Geosciences from the University of Padua in 2022. Currently, I am an assistant researcher specializing in remote sensing for hazard monitoring. My research focuses on interpreting land surface deformation processes and understanding hazard mechanisms by integrating radar remote sensing with other geodetic techniques.
