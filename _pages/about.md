I am a postdoctoral research fellow with the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Houston. I obtained my PhD in Geophysics in 2021 from <a href="https://english.pku.edu.cn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peking University</a>, and BS in Geophysics in 2016 from <a href="https://en.ustc.edu.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Science and Technology in China</a>, China.
