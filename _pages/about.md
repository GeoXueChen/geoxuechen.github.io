I am a postdoctoral research fellow with the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Houston. I obtained my PhD in Geophysics in 2021 from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn), and BS in Geophysics in 2016 from [University of Science and Technology in China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), China.

I am currently working with [Dr. Jiajia Sun](https://sites.google.com/view/jiajiasun) and [Dr. Jiefu Chen](http://www2.egr.uh.edu/~jchen82/) on quantifying the uncertainties of geophysical inverse problems, exploring natural hydrogen resources, and investigating the formation mechanisms of oceanic plateaus using marine magnetic data.

Before joining UH, I completed a two-year postdoctoral research position supervised by [Prof. Qinghua Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mvImZ_oAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) at PKU in 2023.

My research interests include:

- Uncertainty quantification of geophysical inverse problems based on machine learning techniques
- Signal processing, modeling, imaging, uncertainty quantification of electromagnetic data, especially airborne electromagnetic data
- Near-surface hydrological investigation and resource exploration
