<h2>Biography</h2>

I obtained dual doctoral degrees in Geomatics from China University of Geosciences Beijing and in Geosciences from the University of Padua in 2022. Currently, I am an assistant researcher specializing in remote sensing for hazard monitoring. My research focuses on interpreting land surface deformation processes and understanding hazard mechanisms by integrating InSAR with other geodetic techniques.
