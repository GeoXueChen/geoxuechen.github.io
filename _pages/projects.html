<h2>&#127775; Uncertainty quantification for geophysical inverse problems</h2>
<p, align = "justify">
I have a strong interest in addressing uncertainty in geophysical inverse problems. I develop various Bayesian inference approaches,
  including McMC sampling methods, variational inference and generative models from machine learning, to reconstruct the posterior probability distribution
  of solutions and quantitatively evaluate uncertainty.

<h2>&#127775; DL-based AEM data analysis system</h2>
<p, align = "justify">
During my PhD and first postdoctoral program, I focused on developing a comprehensive analysis system for airborne electromagnetic data (AEM) based on deep learning (DL)
  techniques. The system consists of key processes, including denoising, simulation, resistivity imaging and uncertainty analysis. 
  The overall goal is investigating underground structures with higher depth resolution and efficiency.
